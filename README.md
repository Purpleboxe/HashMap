# HashMap

This is my project HashMap made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-hashmap)!

HashMaps are a data structure in computer science used to store key-value pairs. They have a big impact in computer science and this project is my basic implementation on HashMaps.
